# Flask Starter Template

This is a starter template for a Flask project. It provides a basic structure and initial configurations to quickly start developing web applications with Flask.

### Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with your project

### Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/farbautie/template-flask-python.git
```

Set Up the Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
It's recommended to use a virtual environment for this project. You can create and activate a virtual environment using env

```bash
    python -m venv env
    source venv/bin/activate
```

### Install Dependencies

Install the project dependencies using pip:

```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Set Up Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the root of the project and configure the necessary environment variables for your Flask application. These are the required environment variables for the project to function:

```bash
    FLASK_APP='main.py'
    FLASK_ENV='development' | 'production' | 'testing'
    FLASK_DEBUG=True | False
```

### Run the Application

To run the application in development mode, you can use the boot.sh script:

```bash
    ./boot.sh
```

This will run your Flask application in development mode using Flask's built-in server.

### Access the Application

Once the application is up and running, you can access it from your web browser at the following address:

```bash
    http://localhost:8000
```
